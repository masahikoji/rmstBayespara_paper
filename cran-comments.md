## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version, We fix the package refer to below comments:

Comment 1: 

Please do not start the description with the title, "This package", package name, or similar.

* Fixed the description in DESCRIPTION and rmstBayespara-package.R so that they do not start with the presented text.

Comment 2: 

The Description field is intended to be a (one paragraph) description of what the package does and why it may be useful. Please add more details about the package functionality and implemented methods in your Description text.

If there are references describing the methods in your package, please add these in the description field of your DESCRIPTION file in the form authors (year) <doi:...> authors (year, ISBN:...) or if those are not available: <https:...> with no space after 'doi:', 'https:' and angle brackets for auto-linking. (If you want to add a title as well please put it in
quotes: "Title")

* Added the usefulness of the package into the Description field in DESCRIPTION and rmstBayespara-package.R. In DESCRIPTION,
  we added the reference describing the methods in our package using the presented approach.


Comment 3:

You write information messages to the console that cannot be easily suppressed.
It is more R like to generate objects that can be used to extract the information a user is interested in, and then print() that object. 
Instead of cat() rather use message()/warning() or if(verbose)cat(..) (or maybe stop()) if you really have to write text to the console. 
(except for print, summary, interactive functions) -> R/brm_surv.R

* Replaced cat() to message() in R/brm_surv.R.
